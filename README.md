## Overview

I build intelligent systems that connect research-driven machine learning with real-world applications. My recent work spans on-device LLM tooling, NLP-driven ranking engines, generative modeling, and quantum transformer research. I focus on designing systems that balance model performance, interpretability, and scalability.


### Technical Focus

- Full-Stack Software Engineering (Frontend, Backend, APIs)  
- Applied Machine Learning & On-Device AI Systems
- Mobile & Cross-Platform Development (Swift, React, Node.js)  
- Data Pipelines, Model Integration, and Performance Optimization
- Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)

## Selected Projects

### [Saturdays iOS App](https://github.com/tinchil/67443-TYR)
Social time-capsule app that curates photo and video memories with local AI inference.  
- Implemented Core ML and Vision pipelines for photo clustering and face detection.  
- Developed in SwiftUI with AVFoundation for video processing and rendering.  
- Designed modular architecture to support future on-device LLM integration.

### [Zoho Lead Ranking Platform](https://github.com/rosyyang224/zoho-company-ranking-app)
Full-stack CRM and lead-ranking system for biopharma B2B targeting.  
- Designed modular data enrichment, scoring, and ranking pipelines using Python and Streamlit.  
- Integrated Zoho CRM API and custom ranking algorithms for dynamic lead prioritization.  
- Focused on data normalization, enrichment accuracy, and extensibility for future MLOps integration.

### [GANimation Age Extension](https://github.com/rosyyang224/ganimation-age-extension)
Extension of the GANimation framework to support age progression and regression.  
- Introduced an age-modulation subnetwork to preserve identity and dynamic expression features.  
- Applied VGG-based perceptual loss and PatchGAN discriminators for high-fidelity results.  
- Project completed as part of CMU’s 10-423/623 Generative AI course.

### [Quixer Quantum Transformer Research](https://github.com/rosyyang224/quixer-transformer)
Exploration of hybrid quantum-classical transformer architectures.  
- Benchmarked quantum sequence encoders and QSVT-based loss optimizations.  
- Investigated vanishing-gradient mitigation through constrained polynomial design.  
- Conducted experiments on AWS Braket for quantum circuit simulation and validation.
